# Expected Behavior
The delete button has been added to the "Completed Scans" section of the Scan8 tool, and is easily accessible to users. It is labeled with a delete tag match the existing Scan8 user interface. The delete button works as expected, and removes the completed scan files without causing any unintended consequences.


# Current Behavior

Currently, there is no way to delete completed scan files in Scan8, which is problematic for users who want to remove unnecessary scan files from their system.
