# Expected Behavior

Please describe the behavior you are expecting

This pull request adds a new feature according to the issue to Scan8 that allows users to download completed scan results. The download button has been added to the "Completed Scans" section of the tool and works as expected.

What is the current behavior?

There is no download function in the "Completed Scans" section of the tool. So the users can not download the completed scan file results.
